## *Description:*

#### ~~The Chrome Dino Run~~, Chinch vs. Block. The orignal Chrome Dino game consist of a T-Rex trying to jump over a moving object. When you click the screen at the right time the T-Rex should jump over said object. If you click too soon or too late, you lose. However, for this concept. I decided to change it up a bit. Instead of a T-Rex it would be a Chinchiila. This whole game would be constructed by using a couple HTML divs and ten lines of Javascript.

## *Technologies Used:*
* HTML
  * Divs
* Javascript
* CSS
 * Flex
